TODO

Ok so the bo-xy project is getting a bit messy and needs a re-do, with some engineering 
this time.

So going to try suss a structure to help organise things better.

Structure... semi tick. Ok but moving on. 

Stories. Or ... Sequences. Basically what needs to happen, and who needs to do it. 

Ok first Lobbies. The client navigates to /lobbies... then

Client.main.js                | Server.events.js 
reg io(/lobby)  
                                ack connection

Done. Next the user selects either create, or join. 
              
Client.main.js                | Server.events.js 
emit (new)                          
                                ack new
                                create new room
                                assign socket to room
                                call LobbyManager.create() // perhaps we pass the initial socket.io to this to identify the lobby?
                                emit new
ack new
show lobby dashboard (play/leave)

So I think we can show the lobby dash on the same page, just have a hidden div which is populated when create/join is clicked.
Then shown.

Ok at this point I think we'll then redirect users to a new page when they hit play.
Like /dodge. Then it loads the scripts for the game and the game canvas etc.
