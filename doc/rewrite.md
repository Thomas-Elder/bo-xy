It's time to rewrite all pages of this app. Things aren't well planned or structured, and I've
now got a reasonably good idea of all the functionality I want to include on each page and how it
could/should be implemented. 

And honestly that bem stuff has sort of messed me up. I've probably not done it correctly, or it's
just not the solution I need. Need to get back to something simpler. 

I can probably get away with having one page of CSS. If I can create a reusable element style for 
things like lobby elements, highscore and message elements, then I won't need too much CSS at all. 

Then probably handling the js for individual pages would be the best option to maintain some 
separation of concerns.
